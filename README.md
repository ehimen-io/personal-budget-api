# Personal Budget API

An API that allows clients to create and manage a personal budget, following the _Envelope budgeting principles_.

### Envelope Budgeting

The envelope budgeting system divides a user's income into different spending categoriesâ€”bills, groceries, gas, and so on. Once they have decided how much they should spend on each category, they will take that amount in cash and place it into an _envelope_. Then, only spend what's available in that envelope for that category's bills or purchases.

The aim is to prevent the user from overspending by limiting what is available to spend.
